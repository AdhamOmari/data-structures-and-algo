# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
> Trees are a data structure that made of nodes, each node has its own maximum number of children nodes which is K.

> Binary search trees are rooted binary trees data structure which internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the nodeâ€™s left subtree and less than those in its right subtree.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

- Nodes
- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
> The approach is simple we compare the node data and add nodes to the tree based on if the data is larger (to the right node) or smaller(to the left node) than the data of the current node
