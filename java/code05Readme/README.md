# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link. There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly. We will be implementing a Singly Linked List in this implementation.



## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
create a LinkedList class that has a property of head, and have an insert , includes , tostring methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
 time : O(n) ,space=O(1)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
insert : adding nodes to the linked list.
includes : checking for a specific value if it exists in the linked list or not.
toString : looping through the linked list and adding the values in a String variable to be printed.
