# Hashtables
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Hashtable are a data structure that utilize key value pairs.
This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.



## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* add Arguments: key, value Returns:
>This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.

* get Arguments: 
key Returns: Value associated with that key in the table

* contains Arguments:
> key Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

* hash Arguments:
> key Returns: Index in the collection for that key
