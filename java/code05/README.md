# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A linked list is typically used for collecting sequences of objects requiring the need for efficient addition and removal of elements from the middle of the sequence. Linked lists are created by generating series of nodes that contain the values or references of the information needing to be stored.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
> creat linkedlist  and set value in it and then return it , and we can check if the linked list imptye or not 

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

> it was hard 
> O(n)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->


> insert : adding nodes to the linked list.
includes : checking for a specific value if it exist in the linked list or not.
toString : looping through the linked list and adding the values in a String variable to be printed.
